# BIOMEDE_417

I recommend downloading ClassNotes.ipynb notebook. However, if you do not have access to a computer that can open Jupyter notebooks, then you can click on the binder link below to open the notebook. Note that the binder link was created using ClassNotes_Inline.ipynb notebook. The only difference between these two notebooks is how plots are created (interactive vs. inline).
